Temporary Documenation Home. Sorry!

## About

Home★Star / IOTDB is a complete IoT Platform for written by and for developers.

It is built around the following ideas:

* The Internet of Things is about adding APIs to Things.
* There are broad simularites in how Things work that allow them to be universally controlled and monitored
* JavaScript won: it is the language that scripts the web, and it's the language that will script the IoT.
* There should be no cloud dependencies. If the Internet is not around, your Things should continue to work.
